# The AI-driven Revolution in Scientific Computing

## RBA Nov 2024

## Abstract

Several important new scientific computing environments have appeared in recent
years, generated by demand from and investment in artificial intelligence. This
workshop will provide a brief overview of these environments and their features,
including automatic differentiation, parallel computing, and just-in-time
compilers. We will discuss how these tools can be applied to a range of economic
applications.  When possible, attendees should bring laptops to the seminar.
